				<h2>Why <strong>Smart Lol</strong> is so COOL?</h2>
				<section class="coolSectionCenter">
					<h3 class="h3Center">So you guys say that you have covered everything in one tool?</h3>
					<p class="pCenter">Yeah! We have covered everything! Pre game, ingame and post game analysis! You have statistics of all kinds, guides, streamers and even a forum!</p>
				</section>
				<section class="coolSectionLeft">
					<h3 class="h3Left">Wait, Whaaaaat?! I have pre game analysis?</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">Of course buddy! We have created an unique tool (you will never ever ever gonna find something like this) which analyze the champions in the current champion select (real time baby!) and using a very complicated algorithm picks the best champion for the current situation based on your champion pool. Not only that, don't forget that you will have tips for the current match and much more!</p>
					<img src="" class="imgCoolOne" alt="">
				</section>
				<section class="coolSectionRight">
					<h3 class="h3Left">Are you for real?! So... let's see. I have ingame analysis, right?</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">Yeah! The main feature! When the game has started to load. you can search the game using your summoner nickname and find the current game with all the information you need. Aaaaand, yeah!!! You will have a ranking depending on how you play with each champion on ranked. Cool, ha?</p>
					<img src="" class="imgCoolTwo" alt="">
				</section>
				<section class="coolSectionRight">
					<h3 class="h3Left">Ok, we are going great! But, what about post-game analysis?</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">Are you kidding me kiddo? That's pretty much normal stuff! You got all the information of the summoner: Champions, league, ranking, games, bla, bla, bla, and we can be talking for hours...</p>
					<img src="" class="imgCoolThree" alt="">
				</section>
				<section class="coolSectionRight">
					<h3 class="h3Left">Wow, that's amazing! But I want statistics...</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">Bleh! You put this too easy for me! You will have tons of statistics and all kind of stuff, but wait! You will have the recommended items, builds, counters and, as usual, a crapload (can I say that?) of information available for you.</p>
					<img src="" class="imgCoolThree" alt="">
				</section>
				<section class="coolSectionCenter">
					<h3 class="h3Center">Aww man! I think I don’t need anything else! You got everything!!!</h3>
					<p class="pCenter">Wait for it... Don’t get ahead of yourself! You will also need to watch your favourites players in stream! And read guides... and write them if you want! And of course don’t forget the forum where you can talk with the comunity in your favourite language! Told ya! We got everything covered!</p>
